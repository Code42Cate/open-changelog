Hello world ðŸš€

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Changed

- Drop ancient browsers support (use `.fromCodePoint` and other features).
- Rewrite to ESM (including all plugins/deps). CJS fallback still available.
  No signatures changed, except `markdown-it-emoji` plugin.
- Dropped `dist/` folder from repo, build on package publish.
- Set `punicode.js` as external dependency.

### Fixed

- Html tokens inside img alt are now rendered as their original text, #896.
- Hardbreaks inside img alt are now rendered as newlines.
